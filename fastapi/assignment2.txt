Perhaps we can prepare a excel spread sheet?
Or we can create a new web application that does calculation for us

The problem that we're seeing now is that, there are plenty of variables that can play with
and due to the nature of this matter, a lot of things just running through my head when I am feeling tired and sleepy.

What we can do is, to make things easier to understand and absord.

Also there are just too many properties... lol 

Should we try getting a 2 bedroom apartments in some funny location? or 1 bedroom apartment in special location, or have special layout.
